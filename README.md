Today, I read about the Aspen airport issue, where the local community is **strongly opposed** to the FAA's expansion plan—so much so that they're even **playing chicken** with the FAA. These **刁民** are absolute assholes, in my opinion. They don't want tourism, they don't care about emissions or environmental protection whatsoever. According to a YouTube comment, their only concern is:

_"The 0.001% fighting with the 0.01% over the potential opening up of access to the 0.1% in a small ski valley."_

and also:
"It's a NIMBY problem, and a bureaucratic nightmare, but it's so popular that it flourishes despite the limitations."

Their end goal? To keep Aspen as **exclusive and expensive as possible**, ensuring it never caters to the masses. We must **prevent these kinds of assholes and elitist tyrants from sabotaging** our own projects.
